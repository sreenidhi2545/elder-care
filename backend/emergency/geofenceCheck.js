// Geofence breach detection — Phase 3 step 3.
//
// Runs after every stored location reading, from POST /emergency/locations,
// fire-and-forget — same "never a precondition" principle the SOS fanout
// already uses: evaluating geofences must never delay the response to a
// routine location write.
//
// Server-side, not on the device: the background location task already posts
// a reading roughly every 90s (or on 75m of movement — see
// backgroundTracking.js on the frontend), which is the only place a fix
// reliably lands regardless of which screen is open. Doing this on the phone
// instead would mean syncing zone definitions to the device and keeping them
// in sync when a family member edits one remotely, or reaching for OS-level
// geofencing (a separate API from the tracking already built). The trade is
// latency — detection is bounded by however often a reading arrives, not
// instant — accepted because nothing here needs to be pushed to the device.
//
// State is never stored on `geofences` itself. Whether the elderly user was
// last inside or outside a zone is derived by comparing the new reading
// against the *previous* stored `locations` row for the same user — the same
// "derive, don't store" instinct fanout.js already applies to escalation
// progress (there: notifications joined to emergency_contacts.priority;
// here: two consecutive location rows). No previous reading means nothing to
// compare against, so the first reading after a restart — or the first ever
// — just establishes a baseline silently, never fires an alert on its own.
//
// Hysteresis: a transition only counts if the new reading clears the
// boundary by more than its own accuracy_meters (or a fixed fallback when a
// reading has none) — otherwise two GPS fixes a few metres apart near the
// line would flap an exit/enter/exit alert storm out of nothing but noise.

/**
 * Evaluates every active geofence for this user against the just-written
 * location row. `newLocation` is the raw row `createLocation` returned
 * (snake_case columns, NUMERIC fields as strings) — called directly from
 * routes.js, never awaited by the response.
 *
 * Per geofence, a confirmed transition does up to two things, independently:
 *   - fires a new breach alert, if the zone is configured to alert in that
 *     direction (alert_on_exit / alert_on_enter);
 *   - auto-resolves whatever active geofence_breach alert already exists for
 *     that zone, if the zone alerts in the *opposite* direction — leaving a
 *     zone you were alerted for entering, or returning to a zone you were
 *     alerted for leaving, both close the loop the same way. For the common
 *     safe-zone case (alert_on_exit only) this is exactly "auto-resolve on
 *     return"; the same rule also covers a restricted-zone zone configured
 *     the other way around, without needing a second code path.
