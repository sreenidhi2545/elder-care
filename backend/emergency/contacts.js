// ============================================================================
// Emergency contacts — database access
//
// Same split as alerts.js: routes.js decides what is allowed, this file only
// knows how to read and write emergency_contacts rows.
//
// Delete is soft (is_active = FALSE), never a real DELETE — notifications.
// emergency_contact_id references this table, and a hard delete would either
// orphan that history or need ON DELETE SET NULL to erase which contact a
// past alert actually notified. fanout.js already reads only is_active = TRUE
// contacts, so a soft-deleted row simply stops being tried without losing the
// audit trail. There is no way to undo a delete through this API — a phone
// number that was deleted and re-added collides with uq_contact_per_user and
// is reported as validation_failed, same as any other duplicate; only direct
// database access can revive the original row.
