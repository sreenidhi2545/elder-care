// Fanout and escalation.
//
// One function, advanceFanout, does both jobs: called once synchronously
// (fire-and-forget) right after an SOS is created, it notifies contact 1 —
// there being no prior notifications row for the alert yet means "start from
// the top". Called again later by the escalation scheduler once the wait
// interval has passed with no acknowledgement, it notifies whoever comes
// after the last contact that was tried. Same logic, same code path, so
// "who's next" is never computed two different ways.
//
// Deliberately not a schema change: "how far escalation has gotten" is
// derived from the notifications table joined to emergency_contacts.priority,
// not a new column on alerts. See getLastNotifiedContact in records.js and
// BUILD_LOG.md for why.
