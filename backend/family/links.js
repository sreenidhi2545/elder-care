// ============================================================================
// Family links — database access
//
// Same split as emergency/alerts.js: routes.js decides what is allowed, this
// file only knows how to read and write family_links rows.
//
// A family_links row moves through at most these states:
//
//   (none) --invite--> pending --accept--> active --revoke--> revoked
//                          \--decline----------------------> revoked
//
// 'revoked' is reused for both "declined" and "access pulled after being
// active" — link_status has no separate 'declined' value, and adding one is a
// migration this feature does not need just to name a state that behaves
// identically to revoked everywhere it matters: dead link, re-invitable via
// createOrReissueInvite. See declineInvite for the point this is decided.
