// Was a static app.json until this file. Converted so a preview/production
// build can be validated before anything is bundled: EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL must
// be set for those two profiles, or the build fails here — in the first
// seconds of config resolution — instead of producing an APK that silently
// resolves to localhost on the phone. See BUILD_LOG.md's 2026-08-26 entry for
// the incident this exists to prevent: every earlier preview build had no
// apiUrl configured at all and baked in a backend address the phone can never
// reach. development is exempt on purpose — the dev client resolves the
// backend address from Metro's own host at runtime instead (see
// src/shared/config.js's resolveApiUrl), exactly as it does today; this check
// would only get in the way of that path.
//
// EAS_BUILD_PROFILE / EAS_BUILD are set automatically by `eas build` — both
// are undefined for a plain local `expo start`, so this check is a no-op
// outside of an actual EAS build.
