// ============================================================================
// Auth state
//
// Who is signed in, and whether we know yet. Three states:
//
//   restoring  — reading stored tokens on launch. Nothing is decided.
//   signedOut  — no valid session. The login screen is shown.
//   signedIn   — `user` is populated and the role decides the home screen.
//
// "restoring" exists as its own state on purpose. Reading SecureStore and
// confirming the token with the server takes a moment, and without it the app
// would show the login screen for a heartbeat on every launch before replacing
// it — a returning user would see a login flash they never had to act on.
//
// This module is also where the API client gets its wiring, so the client can
// refresh and give up on a session without importing anything from the
// component tree.
