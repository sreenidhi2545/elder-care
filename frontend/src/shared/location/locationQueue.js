// On-device offline queue for background location readings — Phase 3 step 2.
//
// Backed by a JSON file (expo-file-system's legacy, promise-based API — the
// well-worn one, not the new sync/JSI File API this same package also ships;
// a headless background context is exactly the wrong place to be the first
// code in the project to find a rough edge in a newer API). Not SecureStore:
// its encrypted-storage backing on Android has a practical per-value size
// limit that a growing array of readings would eventually hit, and nothing
// queued here is a credential — it's the same coordinates already sent in
// plaintext to the backend once delivered, so encryption buys nothing here
// that would justify that limit.
//
// Capped at MAX_QUEUE_SIZE so an extended offline stretch (phone in a drawer
// for days) can't grow this file without bound. Oldest entries are dropped
// first when the cap is hit — a month-old queued reading has essentially no
// safety value by the time it would ever be sent — but the drop itself is
// recorded, not silent: a silent drop would leave an unexplained gap in the
// location trail later with nothing pointing at why.
