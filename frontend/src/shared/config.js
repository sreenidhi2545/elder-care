 * that file) — always wins when set.
 *
 * Below that, only __DEV__ builds (dev client / Expo Go) fall back to
 * Metro's own host, then to bare localhost — both fine there, since a dev
 * client is either running on the same machine as the backend or is actively
 * connected to Metro on the machine that is. A non-__DEV__ build (preview or
 * production) reaching this point means EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL was missing —
 * app.config.js's build-time check exists to make that impossible for an EAS
 * build, but this is the last line of defence, so it throws rather than
 * silently resolving to a localhost address that can never reach a real
 * server from an installed APK. This is exactly the failure mode that put
 * every SOS location capture in doubt until it was traced — see
 * BUILD_LOG.md, 2026-08-26.
